# custom_SARIMAX : coverging constrained problem..


'''
Unbounded Optimization Problem:
* (L-BFGS-B) optimiser is struggling because the parameter space is too wide or the initial conditions donâ€™t make sense.
* Non-Stationary Data: used diff
* Seasonal Order : validating using fourrier
* Too Many Parameters:High-order ARIMA models (large p, q, P, Q) are computationally expensive and prone to overfitting.
